One year i was in my lab, normally i lock myself inside but dat day it was not locked. A guy came inside, everybody knows if u walk in a lab and c me alone, dat is a sign u must turn around and leave fast don't even greet me just turn around & go. But dat guy did not do dat, he kept walking straight towards me. I was so angry i said "If he pulls a chair and sit down i will make him regret it". He walked in, sat next to me very humble and said i need your help.

He showed me de project but out of anger i was so pissed i pointed a finger and said put it down there i will look at it when i have TIME. He did and walked out very humble with a small voice, after he left i put my eyes back into de screen but my concious was troubling me n said "are u really gonna do dat to such a humble person" I stopped my work & picked up his project, from dat night for de next 3 days i was doing it.

I gave it back to him he submitted & came back with a distinction to thank me. But lil did i know dat was de start of a long bond journey between me & him, today he has become one of my best closest alliance, i can rely on him with great responsibility he will kill it. Normaly wen people come close to me i push dem away i wanna be alone but each time he came to me i cud not push him away, i liked how he was doing it so humble. He became one of de few people i allow to come inside my lab & sit with me. A great and humble man.

Recently we got into an Argument, Have u ever bin so ready to put someone in their place in your life but dey just come at u so humble it breaks your spirit u just end up forgiving without a fight. I won't lie he has my respect he's a good man, not me obvious but good man still do exist out there & he's one of the few.
